- instructions found at: https://code.videolan.org/videolan/VLCKit#installation were not helpful,
but this video helped allot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmdSnCw-Mjw

- open terminal, run cmd:

sudo gem install cocoapods



- write and save a file with tha name: "Podfile" into your project home folder, with the content:

source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
project '~/VLCTester/VLCTester.xcodeproj'
target 'VLCTester' do
    platform :tvos, '10.2'
    pod 'TVVLCKit', '~>3.3.0'
end



- make sure to replace project with your project file path
- make sure to replace target with the name of the TVKit target name



- cd to project folder (to folder where Podfile is located) and run the command:

pod install



- close xcode and use created file: xcworkspace for this project from now on



- make sure you project has the following dependencies (project file -> target -> general -> 'frameworks libraries and embeded content'):

AudioToolbox.framework
AVFoundation.framework
CFNetwork.framework
CoreFoundation.framework
CoreGraphics.framework
CoreMedia.framework
CoreText.framework
CoreVideo.framework
Foundation.framework
libbz2.tbd
libc++.tbd
libiconv.tbd
libxml2.tbd
OpenGLES.framework
QuartzCore.framework
Security.framework
VideoToolbox.framework
UIKit.framework



- lastly create new file (file -> new -> file) choose 'Objective-C file' name it 'header' and press create, choose 'create bridging header'
- at the created file (VLCTester-Bridging-Header.h) add the import line: 
#import "TVVLCKit/TVVLCKit.h"
